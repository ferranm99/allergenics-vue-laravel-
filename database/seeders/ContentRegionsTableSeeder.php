We were so distressed over a time that should have been exciting and fun - baby\'s first solids! Instead of the fun stage of trying new foods, we were dealing with never ending face rashes and even swelling. - we were at a loss and felt like no one was listening to us. We were doing everything we thought was right, like trying the elimination diet at home ourselves, but in the end we needed some help. So reluctantly we reached out to a naturopath as this was an avenue we had never taken before - she advised us to get her hair tested and the rest is history! I can honestly say it was the best money we have ever spent on her. No toys, cool clothes and baby things can ever compare to her health. After her hair test we were able to know what foods her body could and could not tolerate and within days her rashes cleared up and we haven\'t seen a single bump. She is so happy and healthy. After seeing her immediate positive results, I quickly got my hair tested as well, because I have struggled with tummy issues and bloating and cramps my entire life. Just by cutting out the foods that my body was showing intolerance to, I am 12kgs down and counting. Allergenics have changed our lives as well as our family, because now, as a mom I have way more energy and body confidence, I cook and bake with healthier ingredients that I had never heard of, and my family are benefiting from the healthy happiness that all started with cutting a bit of our hair off and sending it away to be tested!

I have no issues with my stomach, just this persistent rash on my face. I took a picture before cutting out dairy and this is the result after only 5 days!

With sleepless nights, sore tummies, constipation and issues with his teeth, we ended up checking for coeliacs, among other things. After 18 months I had become exhausted from the waking every sleep cycle of 45mins and breastfeeding non-stop through the night, that I decided enough was enough and I invested in 3x Allergenics tests for him. It was so sweet and sour to see that yes my son had a major issue, he had very high hydrochloric acid or GORD. He had silent reflux and even on the several occasions I asked our doctor to check into this, because he did not spit up as a baby it was dismissed. However it explained everything from the sleepless nights, to the enamel missing on his teeth. These tests are not only productive and reliable in my clinic, but have also proven invaluable in my personal life. I would highly recommend Allergenics for any case that you find is slow to progress, too complicated to choose the best plan, or your gut feeling says something is not quite right.
